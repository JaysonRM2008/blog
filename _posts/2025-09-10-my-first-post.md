My summer break was different this year because I worked over the summer. The job that I did was a 6-week program working with The Beam Center on running a fair called “The Other World Fair.” There were different groups at this fair: storytelling, music group, woodshop, fashion, and food + biolab (I was in that one). It was located on Governors Island in Nolan Park. I met a lot of people from different cultures.

In the food + bio lab we made a dinner set for our part of the theme, since it the theme was “Whats under the surface” we made a dinner set and use food materials to color, for example to dye the table cloth we use avocados to dye it pink when its boil and yellow onions skin to dye our napkins yellow. Part of my dinner set had a plate which has a drawing of a plant, a cup, a fork, spoon, 

Over the summer, I played games mostly on Roblox. There was this famous game on Roblox that my little sister found called “99 Nights in the Forest.” This game is about surviving through the forest for 99 nights (after 99 nights the game still continues; some players have more than 1,000+ days, but I only have 108 days). You start the game with just an old sack and a rusty axe, barely enough to survive. Your goal is to last 99 nights in a dangerous forest. During the day, you explore, gather resources like wood and food, and try to find diamonds. At night, the forest gets tougher—more enemies come out, and you have to use your weapons and skills to survive.

If you collect enough diamonds, you can buy a class that gives you special gear and abilities. For example, I bought a class that gives me a raygun every time I start, so I’m ready to fight anything, from wild animals to aliens. The key is balancing exploration, gathering, and fighting to survive all 99 nights.

Now back to my summer: my parents bought a new car, a 2022 Honda autopilot. They took our old car, a 2008 Honda van, to a junkyard because it was really old. So we have a new car, and my sister got her license. When she has work, she takes me with her in the car because I go to the school where she works.

As I start my senior year, I am happy, nervous and proud that this is my last year of high school, but also a bit sad because I might not see my friends when they move from NYC to go to college.
