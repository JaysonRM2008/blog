Welcome or welcome back to my blog. This is my second blog.

My name is Jayson and this blog is about debugging.

What is debugging you might ask? Well, debugging is one of the most important skills a programmer can build. It’s the process of finding, understanding, and fixing errors in code so that a program runs the way it’s supposed to. When I debug, I usually follow a simple pattern: read the error, identify where the problem happens, test small changes, and confirm the solution. In my recent debugging worksheet, I went through several code snippets that each had their own challenges. Here’s what I learned from each one.
