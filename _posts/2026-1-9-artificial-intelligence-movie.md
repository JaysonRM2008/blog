The film “I, Robot” is a science-fiction thriller set in a near-future society where artificial intelligence plays a central role in everyday life. The story follows Detective Del Spooner( played by Will Smith), who becomes suspicious of robots after a prominent scientist is found dead under mysterious circumstances. Although robots are programmed to obey humans through the Three Laws of Robotics, the three laws are: <br> 
1) A robot must not harm a human or allow harm through inaction <br>
2) A robot must obey human orders, unless they conflict with the First Law <br>
3) A robot must protect itself, as long as it doesn't violate the First or Second Laws <br>
<br>
 Detective Spooner believes that something has gone wrong 
 specifically with an advanced AI system that may be capable
 of independent thought and decision-making. As the plot
 unfolds, the film raises questions about trust, control, and
 the limits of technology. Examining how artificial
intelligence is portrayed in media like I, Robot is important
because films shape public perception of emerging
technologies. By analyzing this portrayal, we can better
understand society's hopes and fears surrounding AI, as well
as the ethical concerns that come with creating machines
capable of reasoning, learning, and potentially overriding
human authority. <br>
