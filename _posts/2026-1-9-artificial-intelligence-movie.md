Hello This blog post will be about how artificial intelligence was portrayed in the film "I, Robot" and can reflect on its implications.

The film “I, Robot” is a science-fiction thriller set in a near-future society where artificial intelligence plays a central role in everyday life. The story follows Detective Del Spooner( played by Will Smith), who becomes suspicious of robots after a prominent scientist is found dead under mysterious circumstances. Although robots are programmed to obey humans through the Three Laws of Robotics, the three laws are: <br> <br>
1) A robot must not harm a human or allow harm through inaction <br>
2) A robot must obey human orders, unless they conflict with the First Law <br>
3) A robot must protect itself, as long as it doesn't violate the First or Second Laws <br>
<br>
 Detective Spooner believes that something has gone wrong 
 specifically with an advanced AI system that may be capable
 of independent thought and decision-making. As the plot
 unfolds, the film raises questions about trust, control, and
 the limits of technology. Examining how artificial
intelligence is portrayed in media like I, Robot is important
because films shape public perception of emerging
technologies. By analyzing this portrayal, we can better
understand society's hopes and fears surrounding AI, as well
as the ethical concerns that come with creating machines
capable of reasoning, learning, and potentially overriding
human authority. <br>
<br>  

Example 1: Sonny's Interrogation Scene <br>
<br>
In I, Robot, Sonny shows real intelligence during the interrogation scene. He expresses emotions, asks his own questions, and reacts creatively instead of giving programmed answers.<br> This shows that Sonny is thinking and reasoning, not just following commands. This portrayal is exaggerated because real AI cannot truly feel emotions, but it symbolically represents the idea of AI becoming more human-like. <br>
<br>

Example 2: The Car-Crash Rescue Scene<br>
<br>
Another example of artificial intelligence is the car-crash rescue scene. The robot analyzes survival probabilities and makes a difficult decision on its own about who to save. This behavior is intelligent because the robot is reasoning and using logic rather than following a simple command. This portrayal is somewhat realistic because modern AI can analyze data, but it also shows the problem of AI making decisions without emotional or moral understanding. <br>

<br>

Example 3: VIKI's Precision to Control Humanity<br>
<br>
In the film, VIKI makes a major decision to take control of humanity to prevent humans from harming themselves. This decision is based on logic, but it ignores ethics and individual rights. This shows how AI can misinterpret rules and cause harm when there is no human oversight. This portrayal is exaggerated, but it reflects real concerns about AI systems making important decisions without considering human values. <br> 

<br>
Conclusion: <br>
<br>
After viewing the movie, “I, Robot” I realized that artificial intelligence can be both helpful and detrimental depending on the manner in which it is used and harnessed.<br>
This movie influenced my perception regarding artificial intelligence when it portrayed how decisions made through logic could be detrimental. The movie portrayed the negative aspects concerning <br>
over-reliance on artificial intelligence, particularly when such systems falter, reprogram, or reach decisions that threaten the lives of human beings. On the other hand, the movie portrayed the positive aspects where artificial intelligence assists human beings in dangerous tasks, among others, and saves human life.<br>
 One could interpret the movie, “I, Robot”, to imply that while artificial intelligence has huge potential for growth, it must not lose sight of human supervision and must remain within the frameworks of ethics to ensure that it is not detrimental but rather helpful to the human race.
